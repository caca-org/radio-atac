# ðŸš‡ Radio ATAC Discord Bot ðŸŽµ

## What is this?

A Discord bot that brings the official radio station of [Roma MobilitÃ ](https://romamobilita.it/) directly to your Discord server. Experience the authentic sounds of Rome's public transport system while chatting with your friends!

## Why?

Because waiting for the 64 bus gives you plenty of time to appreciate good music ðŸšŒ

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- FFmpeg
- A Discord Bot Token
- A Discord Server (Guild)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/caca-org/radio-atac
cd radio-atac
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it on Unix/macOS

```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your Discord bot token and server ID:
